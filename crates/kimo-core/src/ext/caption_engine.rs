//! KIMO CAPTION ENGINE (V8.12.0): a real caption engine, not a bank of presets.
//!
//! Where `auto_captions.rs` picks one of five hardcoded `Look`s and threads its fields through
//! `page_animators`/`build`, this module exposes the same hard parts -- segmentation, timing,
//! layout/face-avoidance, contrast-aware legibility, per-word state styling, emphasis and keyframe
//! animation -- as composable primitives over a `CaptionSpec` the caller writes. `pop`, `karaoke`,
//! `clean`, `boxed`, `impact` (and `set_caption_style`'s `subtitle`/`boxed`/`yellow`) become spec
//! PRESETS on top of this engine (see `preset_spec`), not separate code paths; `auto_captions.rs`
//! itself is untouched by this file (see the V8.12.0 CHANGELOG entry for the gating decision).
//!
//! Design rule, stated once because it shapes every function below: every default here --
//! segmentation thresholds, CPS, lead-in, gap bridging, avoidance, contrast strength, animation
//! curves -- is a field on the spec, overridable per call, AND overridable per individual word or
//! unit through `overrides`. Free per-word/per-unit keyframes (any property, any time, any easing)
//! sit alongside the rule-based primitives and are applied last, after every rule. The engine's job
//! is smart defaults plus the hard legibility guarantees (no orphan words, no overlapping cues, no
//! sub-minimum flashes) -- enforced only where the caller hasn't already said what they want.
