//! KIMO 8.5 VFX look library: 9 named looks built entirely on vfx_graph (node chains of existing effects,
//! generators and the particles node), each a self-contained graph JSON parameterized by one 0..1 `intensity`.
//! Exposed through apply_vfx_preset (surreal_vfx_tools.rs) alongside V8.4's dreamy/glitch/vertigo/echo, which
//! stay exactly as they were -- these are additional preset names in the same tool, same intensity dial.
//!
//! V8.5.1: a look-library pass driven by looking at real footage, not just technical correctness. 6 of the 9 looks
//! (ember_drift, chrome_bloom, dream_haze, vhs_decay, aurora_wash, glitch_surge) read as "barely there" on a phone
//! screen at a glance -- reworked below, each verified against real footage with vfx_preview before this file
//! changed (see the 8.5.1 commit message / CHANGELOG for the per-look verdict). magic_sparkle and solar_flare were
//! visible but mild and are pushed further. frost_veil was already strong and is untouched. Two lessons the review
//! surfaced: (1) magic_dust's preset default (x=0.5, y=0.5) sits exactly on a centered subject's face -- pushing an
//! already-centered particle preset "further" without repositioning it means more particles ON the face, so
//! magic_sparkle's dust emitters are now framed to the sides/lower-thirds, never centered; (2) light_rays + bloom +
//! exposure stacked at their old intensity ceilings blew solar_flare's highlights past half the frame (41.7%
//! clipping, mean luma 0.86 measured on real footage) -- "unmistakable" and "washed-out" are different failures,
//! and solar_flare's ranges are tuned to stop well short of the second one.
//!
//! V8.5.2: three looks still didn't read at phone size after the 8.5.1 pass -- glitch_surge, vhs_decay, frost_veil.
//! glitch_surge's peak-frame capture (fixed t=0.8s against a 0.55s pulse period) had landed on an already-decayed
//! frame, and even on-hit the ceilings were too low; now two stacked glitch_blocks layers (coarse + fine bands) with
//! a lowered slice_threshold so most of the frame's bands trigger together, a shortened ~0.6s period, and a harder
//! rgb_split pulse. vhs_decay had no low-res softness and no warm cast (a real camcorder skews warm, not neutrally
//! desaturated); added a pre-blur and a post-grain temperature push, and raised wobble/bleed/noise/bands. frost_veil
//! (reworked once already before 8.5.0, then made subtle again in 8.5.1's untouched pass) is graded with
//! color_wheels instead of temperature (temperature's amount is scaled 0.2x internally and reads as almost nothing)
//! and edge_glow now runs on the blurred/graded buffer instead of the raw frame -- edge_glow on the raw frame is
//! exactly what produced v01's "wireframe" face; the vignette is now tinted icy white-blue instead of plain black,
//! and two off-center snow emitters add light drift clear of a centered face.

        // grain+scanlines+chromatic_aberration+saturation alone -- the old chain had no actual line wobble or
        // tracking band, which is most of what reads as "VHS" rather than just "degraded".
        // V8.5.2: added a pre-blur for a genuine soft/low-res feel, raised wobble/bleed/noise/bands, layered a warm
        // `temperature` push after the grain (90s camcorders skew warm, not neutral-desaturated) and widened the
        // vignette -- the v02 chain (vhs + scanlines + grain + flat desaturation) had no low-res softness and no
        // warm cast, which is why it read as "slightly desaturated video" rather than tape.
        // V8.5.3: still didn't read at PHONE-THUMBNAIL size (a 4fps strip at 200px wide) even though it looked like
        // real tape at full size -- measured directly: the native `scanlines` effect darkens exactly 1 row every
        // `spacing` rows, and a slow sine-wave luminance test (tried first, see git history of this comment) reads
        // as a soft vignette, not scanline texture, because the eye needs real edges, not slow brightness drift --
        // both vanish under a ~6x thumbnail downscale. Replaced with two pixel_expr nodes, each verified at both
        // full size and a resized 200px-wide thumbnail before this file changed: `vhs_scanline_expr` is a hard-
        // edged duty-cycle stripe at a fixed pixel period (not spacing-in-rows), which survives the thumbnail
        // downscale as real banding; `vhs_tracking_band_expr` adds brightness + strong hashed noise + extra
        // horizontal jitter inside a smoothstep-falloff band at the SAME roll phase as the `vhs` effect's own
        // (fract(t*0.35)*h), because the `vhs` effect's own band only displaces, it never brightens or adds noise,
        // so the "roll" by itself was never visible at a glance. Also added `levels` for lifted/crushed blacks
        // (a faded, reduced-contrast tape floor -- the old chain had full 0..1 range) and raised the pre-blur for
        // a softer, lower-resolution feel ("downscale and back up, or similar" -- a real downscale/upscale round
        // trip isn't a vfx_graph node, so a stronger blur stands in for it, same approach the brief allowed).
